# Disclaimer on Contributing to this project

This is not a project that will be used by thousands, this is not a project that will be used by many.
If you are wanting to contrubute it is because you are in one of the following pools:

1. You want to learn how to build using the technologies used in this project
2. You want to learn about system design and architecture
3. You are new to OSS and want to learn how to work in a bigger ecosystem and collab with other devs
4. You want to be able to showcase your work to future employers

This project will be deployed and managed by me. Your code will make it into the real world and people will be able to
see it, use it
and interact with it. This is a great way to showcase your work and get your name out there.

You will be able to help guide features and make suggestions and I will genuinely listen to them.

So let's make it fun!

## Getting Started

Make sure you have got everything up and running locally. If you have not check out the [README.md](./README.md) for
more information.

## Contributing

Each story, bug, feature will and should be prepended with what part of the system it affects. If it is multiple then add commas.
If it is all then add ALL.

Create your fork and then check below:

**Stories:**

There are going to be stories under the [issues](https://github.com/codewith-luke/disclone/issues).
Simply look at a story, see if someone is working on it, if someone already is, ask to collab and see if they want to.
This may not always be the case but go for it and try.

I will tag stories with `difficulty` and `priority` so you can see what is important and what is not.

**Bugs:**

If you find bugs, log an issue, if you want to fix it, log an issue and then fix it. Then raise a PR.

**Features:**
I am not going to be taking feature requests at this time. I want to build the core of the application and then we can.

Make sure to check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/46JKsxmSRJ) and ask questions if you have any.
